During the Middle Ages, these paths were connected to the ancient \"Via Francigena\", the important road link between Rome and the rest of Europe, and this is the reason why in this area there are so many old villages and churches. \r\nPodere Incrociati is surrounded by a natural environment, with tracks that go through the woods and that are ideal for mountain-bike, horse-back riding and trekking excursions, during which, with a little stroke of luck, it is possible to meet fallow-deer, badgers, foxes, porcupines, hedgehoges, dormice. \r\nThe building is composed of a mansion built in 1840 during the Gran Duke Leopoldo II of Tuscany's reign, that has been recently restored, without altering its original characteristics.\r\nThe outside fronts have maintained their originality, while inside the building, most part of the ancient hand-crafted brick floors has been restored, as well as the ceilings with their old wooden beams that had been blackened by the smoke of the mantelpieces, which were once the only source of heating; the old irregular walls and the arched ceilings have been preserved, too. \r\nThe old forniture makes the place comfortable and charming, respecting the ancient rural Sienese traditions. \r\nThe place is particularly sunny thanks to a wide natural meadow that lays south of the building, alternating with the woods, and that is at the guests' disposal.

It prefers a firm handshake and a glance that immediately inspire trust. \r\nIt would be like expecting a formal presentation from someone who wants to say how fine he is inside!\r\nThe essence of a place, as of a person, is a discovery that comes about discreetly and silently. It\u2019s a question of feeling; sometimes it happens in a flash, on other occasions you need more time.\r\nThe Val di Merse has a reserved character and travellers fall in love with it because it knows how to be at once shadowy and sunny. Its intimate purity and the intact solitude in which it lives are highly intriguing and are an exclusive invitation to the traveller who is motivated by discreet curiosity.\r\nThe green Val di Merse, with its water and its spread can be crossed in many ways, but to savor it more, it is advisable to do so by foot or on horseback, in order to experience the journey as an unforgettable experience.\r\nAlso the bike is one of the means that can be exploited to explore the valley, thanks to the many routes available to everyone, even families.",

            "description": "\"PODERE INCROCIATI\" rises in the heart of Montagnola Senese, just 15 km/9 miles far from Siena and 75 km/47,5 miles far from Florence, among the greenery of age-old oaks, holm-oaks and chestnut-trees. \r\nIt is an ideal place to take a relaxing holiday far from the city din, among the peace of the country, in contact with an endless cultural heritage within a stone's throw from the sea and the most important Tuscan cities of art. \r\nThanks to its high position (500 mt./1640 ft. above sea level) you will enjoy a well-aired summer suitable for walks in the nearby woods, crossed by several paths, catching sight of charming landscapes, lots of medieval villages and Romanesque parish churches. \r\nThere are thousands of paths through Montagnola Senese, which is a hillock in the heart of the Sienese area. During the Middle Ages, these paths were connected to the ancient \"Via Francigena\", the important road link between Rome and the rest of Europe, and this is the reason why in this area there are so many old villages and churches. \r\nPodere Incrociati is surrounded by a natural environment, with tracks that go through the woods and that are ideal for mountain-bike, horse-back riding and trekking excursions, during which, with a little stroke of luck, it is possible to meet fallow-deer, badgers, foxes, porcupines, hedgehoges, dormice. \r\n\r\nThe building is composed of a mansion built in 1840 during the Gran Duke Leopoldo II of Tuscany's reign, that has been recently restored, without altering its original characteristics.\r\nThe outside fronts have maintained their originality, while inside the building, most part of the ancient hand-crafted brick floors has been restored, as well as the ceilings with their old wooden beams that had been blackened by the smoke of the mantelpieces, which were once the only source of heating; the old irregular walls and the arched ceilings have been preserved, too. \r\nThe old forniture makes the place comfortable and charming, respecting the ancient rural Sienese traditions. \r\nThe place is particularly sunny thanks to a wide natural meadow that lays south of the building, alternating with the woods, and that is at the guests' disposal.
