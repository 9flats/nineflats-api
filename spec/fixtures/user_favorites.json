            "description": "Beautiful houseboat/ship on the Amstel river, 15 minutes from city center by bike or public transport. Boat is located next to the Martin Luther King park - so it's really quiet as there are no other houses nearby (except for neighboring boats). In the summer you can swim in the Amstel, sit outside on the deck in a Fatboy or relax in a hammock.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I'm not offering the entire houseboat. It includes the depicted bedroom - and of course you can make use of the living room, bathroom, and the deck. I will be there as well ;-)\r\n\r\nThere is broadband internet (via wifi) and heating for the colder days. \r\n\r\nThe ship is in sailing condition. If you want to go out on a day trip (at cost), please let me know well in advance, as I have to arrange staff.\r\n\r\nSome notes:\r\n1. Boats were built the move stuff, not people. Therefore the ceilings are not very high. If you are taller than 1.85m, you will not be able to stand up straight everywhere.\r\n2. Google Streetview: these images were shot during the Parade street festival. This is a 2 weeks festival in August - which is great, fun, but noisy. For the rest of the year, the park is quiet and there are no fences or porta potties either.\r\n3. I can't host more than 2 persons.\r\n\r\nHope to welcome you on board of this magical boat.\r\n",
